Notes

1. Trying to initialize something like 

{
    0: [1, 4, 15, 22, 23],
    1: [1, 4, 11, 15, 22, 23],
    7: [1, 4, 15, 22, 23],
    100: [1, 4, 15,  22, 23, 26, 54, 57, 58, 59, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]
}

seemed very painful.

2. Unused variables is painful.
3. getting ultra-specific types on ints is painful.
4. String operations like .strip() don't exist...
